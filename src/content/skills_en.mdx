My doctoral research involved agent-based modeling, data assimilation, and machine learning. This work required the use of Python for modeling in combination with C for CPU-intensive tasks. I completed postgraduate courses in machine learning, parallel computing, and statistics, among others. As a university professor, I oversee programming labs that cover subjects such as Operating Systems using C and Programming Paradigms using Haskell, Java, and Hadoop. I have also explored various parallel computing techniques, including SIMD intrinsics, thread parallelism with OpenMP, and GPU programming with CUDA. Additionally, I utilize technologies like Docker and Git.
