I am Tadeo, I specialize in software development. My journey began as a Bachelor of Mathematics and later I achieved a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences. I am particularly interested in web development, data science, artificial intelligence and video game development. I am a University professor and as such I evaluate a lot of code and favor best practices both for teamwork and software development. Passionate and eager to learn, I can contribute anywhere in the stack.
