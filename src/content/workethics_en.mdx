I have extensive experience in teamwork: from participating in and supervising programming projects to reporting results and writing academic articles. Due to my work ethic, it's important for me to find the right place for each team member where they can feel motivated and passionate, valuing differences in personality and skills, and fostering clear and frank communication channels.
