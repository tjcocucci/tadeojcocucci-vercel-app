My interest in applied mathematics led me to study computer science. This combination provides me with a broad programming toolkit and a multidisciplinary approach to its concepts. I am passionate about learning, and due to my high-level interpretation of computing abstractions, I can quickly incorporate new technologies. My passion for photography, cinema, and video games motivated me to learn programming tools that involve visual aspects. In this direction, I've trained in a variety of resources, from Unity for game development to React for frontend and D3 for data visualization.
