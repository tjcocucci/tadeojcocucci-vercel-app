This game is a basic shooter I created following <CustomLink href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0ctd4dgE1F8g3uec4zKNRV0">this</CustomLink> fantastic tutorial by Sebastian Lague.

It has many features that were a lot of fun to program, such as:

- Procedural level generation with a custom map editor: This allows you to generate obstacles and place them randomly with varying density, while ensuring access to each grid cell.
- Enemy spawning in different positions on the map. But if you camp in the same cell, an enemy will appear on top of you! All enemies have a navigation system that avoids obstacles.
- Different types of weapons (automatic, semi-automatic, single shot) with barrel fire animations and falling cartridges.

Also, following <CustomLink href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3">this</CustomLink> project by Sebastian Lague, I managed to create this procedural terrain generator using Perlin noise, configurable for different numbers of octaves, lacunarity, and persistence values.
Some nice things about this super fun project:

- Customized editor to play with various variables that configure the terrain.
- Terrain tiles are loaded based on the player's position, making the terrain infinite. Additionally, for performance optimization, tiles farther from the player's position have less detail.
- Using shaders, different color and texture levels can be designed for various elevations.
- Threading is used to prevent CPU overload when a new tile needs to be loaded because it enters the player's field of view.
