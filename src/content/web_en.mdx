I built this site with
<CustomLink href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</CustomLink>, a
<CustomLink href="https://reactjs.org/">React</CustomLink> framework and deployed it with
<CustomLink href="https://vercel.com/about/">Vercel</CustomLink>. Code is available at
<CustomLink href="https://github.com/tjcocucci/tadeojcocucci-vercel-app/">this repository</CustomLink>.

The site's content is written in <CustomLink href="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</CustomLink> and embedded as React components by using <CustomLink href="https://contentlayer.dev/">Contentlayer</CustomLink>.

To style the site, I used <CustomLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</CustomLink> and implemented dark and light mode by combining Tailwind's functionality with React's Context. Tailwind's utilities also allowed me to create a responsive layout.

The site supports two languages (Spanish and English), which I achieved by using <CustomLink href="https://www.i18next.com/">i18next</CustomLink> and again a Context Provider. The URL prepends the current language code, which is achieved by customizing Next.js' `middleware.ts`.

<CustomLink href="/map">Here</CustomLink> I created a map of Argentina with Voronoi cells to section the territory in relation to the country's airports. The map is made with <CustomLink href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</CustomLink> and the data comes from <CustomLink href="datos.gob.ar">datos.gob.ar</CustomLink>
