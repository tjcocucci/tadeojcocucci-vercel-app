This map shows Argentina's airports. The data is from [datos.gob.ar](datos.gob.ar). Each airport is represented by a circle. The cells are Voronoi cells: the cell that corresponds to a given airport is defined by the set of points that are closer to that airport than to any other airport.

There is another airport in Islas Malvinas but I excluded it because it was not named in the dataset.
